### Hi there, I'm Alicja 👋

I'm a Frontend Developer from Poland. I love learning new things everyday, trying to make Internet more beautifull.

Before I dived into programming and discovered it as my new passion, I've done many things which led me to this point, some of them are still ongoing journeys:

:bulb: working as a Lighting Designer <br>
🤖 studying Robotics and Electrotechnics <br>
:art: drawing and painting <br>
:v: yoga <br>
👩‍🍳 cooking addict
:earth_africa: ecology and living sustainable lifestyle <br>
:mouse: owner of 2 gerbils <br>
:guitar: playing classical guitar <br>
:swimmer: swimming section at the University <br>
