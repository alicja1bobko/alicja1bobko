### Hi there, I'm Alicja 👋

I'm a Frontend Developer from Poland. I love learning new things everyday, trying to make Internet more beautifull.

Before I dived into programming and discovered it as my new passion, I've done many things which led me to this point, some of them are still ongoing journeys:

:v: &nbsp; yoga <br>
👩‍🍳 &nbsp; cooking addict <br>
:earth_africa: &nbsp; ecology and living sustainable lifestyle <br>
