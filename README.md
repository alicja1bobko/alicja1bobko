### Hi there, I'm Alicja 👋

I'm a Frontend Developer from Poland. I love learning new things everyday, trying to make Internet more beautifull.

Before I dived into programming and discovered it as my new passion, I've done many things which led me to this point, some of them are still ongoing journeys:
 
💡  &nbsp; working as a Lighting Designer <br>
🤖 &nbsp; studying Robotics and Electrotechnics <br>
🎨 &nbsp; drawing and painting <br>
☮️ &nbsp; yoga <br>
👩‍🍳 &nbsp; cooking addict <br>
🌍 &nbsp; ecology and living sustainable lifestyle <br>
🐭 &nbsp; owner of 2 gerbils <br>
🎸 &nbsp; playing classical guitar <br>
🚴‍♀️ &nbsp; discovering my city from different perspective <br>
🏊‍♀️ &nbsp; swimming section at the University <br>
